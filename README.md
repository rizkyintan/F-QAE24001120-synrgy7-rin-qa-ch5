**Chapter 5: Java and Object-Oriented Programming üòç‚ú®**

Hi folks! I am currently learning Software Quality Assurance at SYNRGY Batch 7. This repository serves as a dedicated space for storing code and resources related to my quality assurance learning and development journey. This repository is specifically designed to provide a comprehensive overview of Chapter 5, focusing on Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this repository, I made two OOP-implemented programs. The first program is designed to calculate parking fees, and the second program is a simple banking application for storing and withdrawing money. This chapter focuses on learning and gaining a deep understanding of the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
