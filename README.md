# Welcome to my Quality Assurance Learning Repository! 🚀

Helo, my name is Rizky Intan Nurlita. I am currently learning Software Quality Assurance at 
SYNRGY Batch 7. This repository serves as a dedicated space for storing code and resources related to my quality assurance learning and development journey.
This repository is specifically created to document my progress and share the materials I have worked on
throughout the course.

Here in Chapter 5, we are focusing on **Java and Object-Oriented Programming** (so fun! 😍✨)
