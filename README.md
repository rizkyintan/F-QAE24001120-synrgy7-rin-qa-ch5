# Welcome to my Quality Assurance Learning Repository! 🚀 
### Chapter 5: Java and Object-Oriented Programming 😍✨

Hi folks! I am currently learning Software Quality Assurance at SYNRGY Batch 7. This repository serves as a dedicated space for storing code and resources related to my quality assurance learning and development journey. This repository is specifically designed to provide a comprehensive overview of Chapter 5, focusing on Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this repository, I made two OOP-implemented programs.

* **Program 1: Parking Fee Calculator 🚗🅿️**
The Parking Fee Calculator program demonstrates the practical application of OOP principles in calculating parking fees based on the duration of the stay and the type of vehicle. 
* **Program 2: Simple Banking Application 🏦💰**
The Simple Banking Application illustrates how OOP can be used to manage financial transactions. It includes functionalities for depositing and withdrawing money, and checking account balances.

Instead of focusing on the program functionality, this chapter focuses more on learning and gaining a deep understanding of the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
